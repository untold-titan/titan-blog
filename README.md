# My Personal Blog
PLEASE NOTE:
This project is in the process of being redesigned, and reworked. 
Stay tuned for a updated version.

## What is this project?
This project is built to be a site for me to post about experiments related to coding, and other things I work on.
I also intended for it to be a way for me to host my web based experiments, and a way for friends/family/people interested in my work to see stuff I do, and rate it and give feedback. 

## What techonologies are you using?
This is a project that I ended up canning, because I made the scale too big for the inital release. 
By that, I mean I added too many technologies, and ideas too fast.

I used:
- Svelte
- SvelteKit
- Vite (the best build tool imo)
- Playwright (except I didn't write any tests)
- Firebase (Gonna be switched to my own hosted pocketbase instead)

## What's the roapmap look like?
Good question. Since this project is archived now, I am probably going to be remaking this project at a later date.
Check my profile's README for projects that are actively being worked on.
